        <h1>Mountain biking resources</h1>
        <p>Welcome to all about mountain biking! Here you can learn the basics of mountain biking</p>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Hardtail or full suspension?</h2>
            <p>The term Hardtail or Fully does not describe the bike's frame. Rather, it describes the bike's suspension
                system.</p>
            <h3>Full Suspension MTB</h3>
            <p>With the Full Suspension, the front wheel and back portion of the bike have suspension. The full
                suspension helps compensate for
                shocks in uneven terrain, and a front suspension helps the front wheel maintain contact with the ground
                when going
                uphill. Suspension also helps protect your back.</p>
            <p>Where it shines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>high speeds</li>
                <li>challenging and steep terrain</li>
                <li>Jumps and drops</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>heavy</li>
                <li>expensive due to large components</li>
                <li>maintenance-intensive</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hardtail (back wheel has no suspension)</h3>
            <p>With Hardtail, just the front wheel has suspension. The rear wheel does not have suspension. A Hardtail
                is suitable if
                you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>want to be fast and agile on the road</li>
                <li>bike mainly on forest roads and flat tracks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not all mountain bikes are created equal. Each MTB discipline is different and therefore has different
                needs. While the
                differences are not always crystal clear, you can mainly distinguish the types based on their suspension
                systems.</p>

            <h2>Different types of Mountain Bikes</h2>
            <h3>Cross country bike</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/xc.jpg" alt="Cross Country Bike">
            <p>The bike is mainly used in cross-country races. Races usually take place:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>through forests</li>
                <li>through fields</li>
                <li>on gravel paths</li>
                <li>on meadow paths</li>
                <li>through paths with smaller gradients and descents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The focus with cross county MTB is on maneuverability and a sporty riding position.</p>

            <h3>All mountain & enduro bike</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/enduro.jpg" alt="All Mountain/Enduro Bike">
            <p>The All Mountain Bike describes a wide range of uses, namely in the mountains. It is suitable for</p>
            <ul>
                <li>easy and longer tours in the lowlands (at around 10 - 14 kg, it is considered light)</li>
                <li>ascents</li>
                <li>downhill descents on easy and medium-difficulty trails</li>
                <li>small jumps and drops</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The focus with cross county MTB is on maneuverability and a sporty riding position.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Suspension: </span class="bold">Full Suspension</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Amount of suspension give: </span class="bold">120 - 160 mm</p>
            <p>You can reduce or lock the give on the suspension system on many models. This makes it easier for you to
                ride uphill.</p>
            <p>The <em>Enduro Bike</em> is a mix between the all mountain bike and the freeride mountain bike. It is
                designed for a wide range
                of uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>faster descents than the all mountain bike</li>
                <li>higher jumps than the all mountain bike</li>
                <li>easier to ride uphill than with the freeride mountain bike</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="bold">Suspension: </span class="bold">Full Suspension</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Amount of suspension give: </span class="bold">140 - 180 mm</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h3>Downhill mountain bike</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/dh.jpg" alt="Downhill Bike">
            <p>The downhill mountain bike is made:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to traverse challenging trails with steep gradients as fast as possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The shape of the downhill mountain bike is unmistakable: wide handle bars, thick tyres and a low saddle,
                for an optimal
                centre of gravity.This type of mountain bike is quite heavy at 18 kg, because the frame must withstand
                the stress of big jumps. The tyres
                are thick and have good grip. Riding uphill is virtually impossible for a downhill mountain bike.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Suspension: </span class="bold">Full Suspension</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Amount of suspension give: </span class="bold">180 to 250 mm</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h3>Freeride mountain bike</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/fr.jpg" alt="Freeride Mountain Bike">
            <p>The bike is cross between a downhill and cross country mountain bike. They are made for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>very steep terrain</li>
                <li>technical obstacles and trails</li>
                <li>Long and high jumps and drops</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While the freeride mountain bike is slightly lighter than its downhill counterpark, it's still no
                featherweight. Very
                stable components are used to ensure mountain bikes withstands extreme jumps (up to 20 meters).
                Therefore, mountain
                bikes are priced a bit higher. Some Freeride mountain bikes are also suitable for uphill riding.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Suspension: </span class="bold">Full Suspension</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Amount of suspension give: </span class="bold">165 - 200 mm</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h3>Fat bike</h3>
            <img src="resources/images/fb.jpg" alt="Fat Bike">
            <p>Fat bikes are made for tough surfaces, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>snow</li>
                <li>ice</li>
                <li>sand</li>
                <li>surfaces with bad traction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can recognise fat bikes by their wide tyres. At 4 to 4.8 inches, they are twice as wide as
                conventional mountain
                bike tyres. A <em>suspension system</em> is often not included with fat bikes. The wide tyres are kept
                at below normal levels to absorb most
                of the shock.</p>
